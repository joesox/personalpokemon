# Development Introduction #

Personal Pokemon (PPokemon) is currently in Active Development.  This means that not all of the planned features are fully developed yet.  PPokemon is on a quarterly development schedule.  If you are interested in participating in this project email joesox.  I am interested in someone taking the lead in this project.

## Project Background and Mission Statement ##
This project was started just because I couldn't find a Pokemon Solitare game. My son got me in to Pokemon and the Trading Card Game.  I discovered the existing Pokedex on the Pokemon website was for personal use so I designed the application for personal use in order to utilize the information avialable.
I quickly designed the project and I would like to seperate some parts of it in to their own dlls for easier development and patching/upgrades.

## Developer Standards ##
We ask that all developers use the following guidelines to ensure stable versions and not break any versions of PPokemon.


### PPokemon Development: ###
  1. Work with a copy of the latest version PPokemon Visual Studio project.
  1. Thoroughly test your working copy.
  1. Repeat step 1 - 3 until no bugs.
  1. Commit changes.
  1. Update issue trackers.
  1. If needed, make sure joesox updates PPokemon websites with current documentation
